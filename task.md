🚀 Fraud Detection Dashboard Design for WooEasyLife
A fraud detection dashboard should provide clear, actionable insights on customer risk levels, fraud scores, and suspicious activities. Below is a structured breakdown of the dashboard components:

📊 Fraud Detection Dashboard Layout
🔹 Key Metrics (Top Summary Cards)
These cards provide a quick overview of fraud-related data:

Total Orders Scanned for Fraud → Shows the total number of orders evaluated for fraud.
High-Risk Orders → Number of orders flagged as high-risk (fraud score > 75).
Medium-Risk Orders → Number of orders flagged as medium-risk (fraud score 50-75).
Low-Risk Orders → Number of orders flagged as low-risk (fraud score < 50).
Total Blacklisted Customers → Number of emails, phone numbers, and IPs in the blacklist.
📈 Fraud Score Distribution (Bar Chart)
X-Axis: Fraud Score Ranges (0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-100)
Y-Axis: Number of Orders in Each Range
Color-Coded (Green: Low-Risk, Yellow: Medium-Risk, Red: High-Risk)
🛑 High-Risk Orders List (Table)
